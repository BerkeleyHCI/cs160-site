					<div class="col-xs-16 col-sm-6">
						<p class="lead">
							Each week there will be a set of readings that will prepare you for concepts covered in lecture. Submit a substantive yet succinct response that demonstrates youâ€™ve done the reading onto bCourses. Reading responses are due before class on Thursday. Reading Response extra credit does not offset missed courses in participation grade. The late policy does not apply to reading responses. Zero tolerance policy for late reading responses. 
						</p>
						<h2><strong>Scoring</strong></h2>
						<p><span>Reading responses are scored out of 2 points; getting a 2 means you received full credit.</span> Reading responses are part of your <em><a href="grading.html">Class Participation</a></em> grade. 

						</p>
						<p><span>0 means you submitted late or didn't submit at all.</span></p>
						<p><span>1 means you didn't completely answer the prompt.</span></p>
						<p><span>2 means your response contributed much more to the discussion that just recapping/summarizing the readings.</span></p>

						<p><em><span>Describe a recent frustrating experience you have had interacting with a digital device or system. &nbsp;Discuss how following the design process outlined in the reading could have improved the design.</span></em></p>

						<h3><span>2 PT</span></h3>
						<p><span>I have always been an avid user of Snapchat but one thing that frustrates me is its user interface. Last week, I snapped a picture and sent it to the 15 members of my club. However it took an extremely long time to go through my entire friends list of 150+ people to select those 15 people because the friends list is sorted alphabetically. Today I wanted to do the same thing and was extremely frustrated that I had to repeat the entire process again.</span></p>
						<p><span>In order to improve on this system we have to first figure out who is going to use this app. Most people using this app are teenagers and young adults. Most teenagers aren't going to have just a couple dozen of friends added; they're going to have hundreds. Recognizing this issue would make it necessary for an easy way to organize people on their list of friends. A representative task for this app would be for someone in this target demographic to snap a photo and send that photo to fifteen friends who are in the same club.</span></p>
						<p><span>Next it would be best to plagiarize the way that Facebook sorts its messenger. Currently, Snapchat has three ways to sort your friends: best friends, most recent, and alphabetically. If you have 15 people to send your snap to, and only one person is on your best friend's list and one person is on your most recent list, then any of these methods are useless. The way Facebook allows you is through the following three ways: suggested friends, your own groups, and alphabetical. This method is much more intuitive, because if you wanted to send a picture to people from the same club, you could just make a group on Snapchat for that club, then snap the photo, select that group, and send it. Then the next time you want to send to the same group, you would not have to select each person individually again. Next using GOMS analysis and figuring out how many steps it would take for someone to add a group and send multiple photos to that group will verify the need for groups in the app. </span></p>
						<p><span>I believe that adding a group function to the Snapchat friend list will surely make the lives of its users less frustrating and hopefully they do so in the future.</span></p>
					
						<h3><span>1 PT</span></h3>
						<p><span>When entering a recurring event into Google Calendars, you&rsquo;re able to choose how often you want an event to happen, daily, weekly, every weekday, whatever you want. These options are listed as a 7 checkboxes, one for each day. However, if you select all days M-F and try to update the days the event is supposed to recur, the checkboxes disappear and they show up as &ldquo;Daily&rdquo; instead. The only way to reassign the days is by deleting the event and creating a new event. Whoever designed the interface must have reasoned that switching to &ldquo;Daily&rdquo; makes it more convenient to easily view which days have been selected, which is true. However, it prevents the user from updating their preferences. </span></p>
