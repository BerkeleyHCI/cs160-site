We do this by giving family members real-time updates about the status of the patient, allowing them to more effectively organize help. By tracking how well the patient remembers to do their daily tasks, we can provide family members and medical professionals with valuable data about the progression of the patient's symptoms, hopefully allowing them to tailor treatment specifically to the individual."

The watch with the app can be placed on the infant’s bed with a special enclosure to detect baby’s movements or crying sounds. The app features Crib Mode, in which parents receives notification where their baby is about to wake up and start moving, and Nursery Mode, when parents receive alerts when their baby starts crying and needs immediate attention. Parents can also see summaries of their baby’s sleeping data to better track the baby’s status over the long term. By making new parent feel reassured when they aren’t within earshot of their baby, we hope to assist new parents in what would otherwise be the overwhelming task of constant parenting."

This project provides a non-intrusive way of encouraging these teens to eat via positive reinforcement, while monitoring them without having to bring up the topic of food. When the user eats, he or she can feed their pet (Bubba), who will react cutely. Their pet will encourage healthy eating habits as well as track the user’s eating patterns (to ensure their safety) and feelings about eating (to track their progress and app usage)."

Additionally, many children also forget to floss, use mouthwash, or use their retainers (if needed). In most cases, these problems occur due to distraction while performing the tasks, not knowing proper technique, or being unaware of the potential consequences. Often times, children end up carrying these poor brushing and flossing habits into adulthood. Our app aims to teach young teens and young adults about maintaining proper dental hygiene habits through friendly competition using streaks.Users can follow the timed steps on the smartwatch to properly brush and floss their teeth.They can view their brushing habits and how well they do compared to their friends on their phone."

Doctors will be able to code the data and graphs by the medication the patient is taking, which will allow them to compare how patients react to the various medications. This will allow them to create more personalized treatments, which is necessary since Parkinson’s is a disease that affects everyone in different ways."
