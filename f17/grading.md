- 25% Individual and Small Group Programming & Design Assignments
- 20% Midterm
- 40% Final Group Project
- 15% Class Participation (Attendance, Reading Responses, Class Participation, bCourses interaction)

There will be required reading responses, individual programming and design
assignments and a midterm, but much of the grade comes from the final design
project. This is a design class with an emphasis on identifying and satisfying
users' needs. Unlike most CS classes there is not a single “correct” solution,
and you will have to make trade-offs. In this class you will learn to both
design new interfaces and evaluate the pros and cons of the interfaces you
design. As you complete the assignments for this class you should try to point
out both the pros and the cons of the interfaces and applications you design
and the choices you made.

Design is typically evaluated in a qualitative manner. As a result a
significant portion of the grading in this class will be qualitative, including
assessments of the end user experience of the system and the quality of your
designs, evaluations, and prototypes. Evaluation feedback will be given by
course staff, outside experts, and your peers. It will be important for you to
communicate your goals and choices effectively in written and oral presentation
within the page limits and time allowed.

Each group is responsible for making sure that all members are participating.
As part of the project reports, you are required to describe the effort put in
by each member, both on specific tasks and as a fraction of the group’s effort.
Make sure you discuss this regularly, to make sure your group is in agreement
about the work breakdown. Effective group work (which entails some amount of
conflict resolution) is a key skill for success in industry. We would like you
to work through conflicts if at all possible, and we will devote some class
time to this topic. Your project assignments include self-reports of effort by
all team members. It’s very important that team members contribute equally. If
issues arise around group work, please contact the staff promptly.

## late policy

Group project assignments may not be turned in late, as we want to give quick
and timely feedback, and you should be able to work together as a group to turn
in assignments on time. Individual project and design assignments will lose
points as follows:

- 1 min — 24 hours:  -10% (weekends count)
- 24 hours — 48 hours:  -20%
- 48 hours — 72 hours:  -40%

Assignments submitted more than 72 hours late will not be accepted. This does not apply to reading responses; there is a zero-tolerance for late reading responses.

## regrading policy

As mentioned earlier, grading design projects is largely qualitative, and may
give rise to disagreements. We encourage you to discuss grading concerns
directly with your TA. If that cannot be resolved, you may invoke a regrade
process by emailing a copy of your assignment and a written description of why
you believe the grade was unsatisfactory no sooner than two days but within two
weeks after receiving the grade. Submit the regrade request to John Tang’s
email. An independent TA will regrade the entire assignment; this means that
your grade could go up or down. Entering the regrade process means that you
agree to that process.
